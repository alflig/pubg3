    <p>In just a couple of months since its release, PUBG has already attached a couple of major tournaments to its name. However, with how things are going at the moment, we don’t think the bandwagon will stop anytime soon. PUBG’s dominion has just kicked off.</p>

        <p>With each passing day, more and more major organizations are looking into expanding their teams with official PUBG rosters. And since markets like Twitch and Youtube are filled to the brim with hundreds, if not thousands of potential professional players, these organizations take no time in recruiting players. In just the past month, we have seen over at least three or four major organizations including FaZe Clan, Team Liquid, and Evil Geniuses, who have announced their official rosters for PUBG.</p>
            <p>As a result, you can already foresee the excitement that is to follow. This is the reason why we have taken out time to bring you a list of ten PUBG teams which we think will come out with some of the best plays you’ve seen so far. From nailing someone to the ground with a pan to running an entire squad over with a motorcycle, these teams are the ones that do just that. Hence, if you wish to see the best, more bizarre plays of PUBG, then we highly recommend you to keep an eye on the following 10 teams.</p>

    <h1>FaZe Clan</h1>

        <p>The most recent major addition to the PUBG competitive scene is the entry of FaZe Clan. The North American organization has been quite active in the esports scene and with PUBG gaining momentum, this was the perfect time for FaZe Clan to make its mark. Hence, FaZe Clan signed the entire roster of Gorilla Core due to their remarkable record in PUBG.</p>
            <p>Ever since Gorilla Core kick-started its PUBG competitive scene, the team has been unstoppable. In just a short period of time, GC had quite an amazing record which skyrocketed the team to the top of the Showdown Series leaderboards, where it still holds the #1 spot. However, with the team gaining so much popularity, it caught the attention of some of the bigger organizations in the esports market. And now with these players playing under the banner of FaZe Clan, we think the team will get better in the future tournaments to come.</p>

    <p>When one of the biggest esports organizations of the world, Team Liquid, announced its PUBG roster, we knew things were about to get a whole lot more exciting. Team Liquid has made quite a mark in the professional online gaming industry, especially with its Dota 2 roster which is currently ranked #1 in the world. A lot was expected from the PUBG roster and with what went down during the Gamescom Invitational, one can’t say the team did not live up to its name.</p>
        <p>Though Team Liquid failed to achieve a spot in the Gamescom Invitational 2017 top three, they did come close to doing so. After Team Noble’s impressive kill count, Team Liquid was forced to be content with the fourth position. However, even then, the team proved that they have what it takes to win, especially Hayz, who managed to secure the silver trophy in the Solo TPP event.</p>

    <p>Being one of the first teams to enter the profession PUBG scene, Team SoloMid has already made a name for themselves with a solid performance at the Gamescon. Though TSM did come close to winning the Gamescom Invitational 2017, it failed to secure a position spot. However, one of the team’s players, Gary “BreaK” Marshall, did finish second in the tournament’s Solo TPP event.</p>
        <p>Since then all four of TSM’s players have been playing non-stop, practicing for the future tournaments. So much so that SmaK, BreaK and Viss have attained tops ranks in the global PUBG leaderboards. Now you can imagine just how powerful TSM has become. And with IEM Oakland just around the corner, it will be exciting to see what this team has up its sleeves.</p>

    <p>Ever since Gamescom Invitational 2017 has concluded, a number of players have stepped into the light, showcasing what they can do in PUBG. However, there was one team that outshined everyone, in almost all of the events which took place during the event. We are talking about the North American team, Luminosity Gaming.</p>
        <p>The entire team, especially its core player, Tyler “Ninja” Blevin, was very consistent during the tournament. However, it was on the final day where we saw what Luminosity Gaming can achieve. The entire team played brilliantly during the final day, winning two out of the three matches. This snowballed Luminosity Gaming to achieve a total score of 1000+ and hence, take home the coveted “Golden Pan” trophy.</p>

    <h1>NIP</h1>

        <p>Ninjas in Pyjamas is one of the most prominent teams to recruit a roster for PUBG pro scene. The team has yet to compete in a major event. However, the reason why we think NiP will be a tough contender in the upcoming tournaments is because of the team’s roster. It has got talented players who have made their mark in PUBG.</p>
            <p>Though NiP did not take part in the previous Gamescom Invitational 2017 PUBG tournament, a few of its players were present. Sweaterr, Crunch and Borg did play the tournament, under the banner of Cloud9. While, Borg and Sweaterr took home the runners-up trophy in the Duo TPP event, all three players were ranked in the tournament’s leaderboard. As a result, with all these players in NiP with the addition of Ekkz, it will be interesting to see where the road takes them next.</p>

        <article>
        <p>In the past few months, Penta Sports has made quite the name for itself in the world of PUBG. With a number of wins in the PUBGOnline Showdown Tournament Series, leading them to the #1 spot in October, Penta Sports is a true contender. However, the team has failed to maintain its first position and currently stands at #3 in the European leaderboards as we write.</p>
            <p>Although inconsistent, Penta is good enough to make big plays in upcoming events, which is why it deserves a spot in our top 10 list. The team has the potential to become one of the best teams if they work on the few things they lack.</p>
